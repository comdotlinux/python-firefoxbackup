python-firefoxbackup
====================

Automating backups of Firefox using MozBackup and Python 3 with out using third party modules to keep the usage simple.

This is for use only on windows, where in Corporate environments the OS is primararily windows.
I use Firefox and it's Sync extensively and like to have plenty of backups in case of disaster.

Usage is simple, You Need :
1. Moz Backup from http://mozbackup.jasnapaka.com/
2. Python 3 from http://www.python.org/
3. This python script.

Just modify MozBackup.properties a use windows scheduler to backup firefox at specific time by running this script.

Please do let me know any Improvements, I am fairly new to Python.
